sample.plural = {0,number,integer} {0,choice,0#dogs|1#dog|1<dogs} should be pluralized and number formatted correctly. The provided argument was '{0}'.
sample.simple = This is a simple message string with no substitutions.
sample.bad=             Thi's is "quoted stuff" with a /forward slash and a \backward slash and <b>markup</b> and preceding whitespace.
#sample.commentedOut = This should not appear since the value was quoted out.

sample.overlappingGreaterThan = {0,choice,0>0|-2>-2|4000>4000|-1>-1|-3>-3} is the least of 0, -2, 4000, -1, -3 that is greater than {0}
sample.overlappingLessThan = {0,choice,0<0|-2<-2|4000<4000|-1<-1|-3<-3} is the greatest of 0, -2, 4000, -1, -3 that is less than {0}
